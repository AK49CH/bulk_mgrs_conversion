# bulk_mgrs_conversion
This Python script converts Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) coordinates to geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) in bulk. It takes a CSV file that has a column named 'MGRS' as an input, and outputs a new CSV file that has two additional columns named 'Latitude' and 'Longitude'.
